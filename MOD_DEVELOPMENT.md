### Dependencies
- NeoForge (required)
- KubeJS (optional, recommended for testing generated scripts)

### Build & Release
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automated builds on push/PR
- **Release Automation** - Creates GitHub releases on version tags
- **Artifact Output** - JAR files in `build/libs/`

## Usage Flow

1. Player presses 'K' in-game
2. Main menu opens with recipe type options
3. Player selects recipe type (e.g., "Botany Pots Crops")
4. Form opens with fields for recipe data
5. Player fills in fields (items, counts, chances, etc.)
6. Player clicks "Generate & Download Script"
7. Mod creates JavaScript file in `kubejs/server_scripts/`
8. Player receives confirmation message with file path
9. Scripts are automatically loaded by KubeJS on next server reload

## Example Generated Script

### Botany Pots Crop
```javascript
// Botany Pots Crop Recipe
// Generated by KubeJS GUI Editor

ServerEvents.recipes(event => {
    event.custom({
        type: 'botanypots:crop',
        seed: { item: 'minecraft:wheat_seeds' },
        categories: ['dirt'],
        growthTicks: 2400,
        display: { block: 'minecraft:wheat' },
        results: [
            { chance: 1.0, output: { item: 'minecraft:wheat' }, minRolls: 2, maxRolls: 4 },
            { chance: 0.5, output: { item: 'minecraft:wheat_seeds' }, minRolls: 1, maxRolls: 2 }
        ]
    });
});
```

### Create Mixing (Heated)
```javascript
// Create: Mixing Recipe
// Generated by KubeJS GUI Editor

ServerEvents.recipes(event => {
    event.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [
        '#forge:dusts/glowstone',
        'create:powdered_obsidian',
        'create:polished_rose_quartz'
    ]).heated();
});
```

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- More Create recipes (pressing, cutting, deploying, mechanical crafting, sequenced assembly)
- More Botany Pots types (soils, fertilizers)
- Recipe browsing/editing of existing scripts
- Visual item/block selection instead of text entry
- Recipe validation
- Import existing recipes from datapacks
- Multi-recipe batch creation
- Recipe templates

## Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCrazy8/compot.git
cd compot
./gradlew build
# Output: build/libs/kubejs-gui-editor-1.0.0.jar
```
